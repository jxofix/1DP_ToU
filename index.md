<div>These General Terms of Use for Digital Products and Services (“Terms”) set out the general conditions for providing our products and services in the digital environment. Our mutual rights and obligations regarding the relevant digital products, and other useful information about our relationship with you as a consumer or a business person (“you”) are stated below.

<details><summary style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Our digital products and services</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 3vw"> We provide products and services in the digital environment. For ease of understanding, we will use the term “digital products” in these Terms to refer to the following digital products and services we provide:</p>  
 
   <p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-weight: bold">Your digital Škoda ID account</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 5vw"> Škoda ID offers you an easy way to log in to other digital products. You can also save personal data (e.g., name, addresses, telephone numbers) in your Škoda ID. </p>
   <p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-weight: bold">Smartlink</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 5vw">Smartlink makes it possible for you to access the wide range of services or features described below. You can easily verify the vehicle status and get up-to-date information including current driving data, inclusive statistics (both in retrospect and in real time), journey logs and trip planning. In order to use the digital products, you must have the Smartlink or Smartlink+ system. For more information, please refer to your owner's manual or ask your Škoda Auto partner.</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-weight: bold">Car Feedback</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 5vw">Car Feedback serves for car rating, gathering the first emotion and product satisfaction from you. Car Feedback enables you to submit a rating regarding your car in real time directly to Škoda Auto. You can submit positive, neutral and negative rating. The goal is a continual product improvement and better user experience.</p>
   <p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-weight: bold">Car configurator </p>
   <p style="margin-left: 5vw">The configurator allows you to build a car in the configurator digital environment reflecting your wishes and ideas. Note that the purpose of the configurator is not to offer the displayed cars for sale or to promote them, i.e. it is not an offer within the meaning of Section 1732 of Act No. 89/2012 Coll., Civil Code, as amended. Also please note that all prices listed in the car configurator are recommended prices and they are for information purposes only, as is any other data related to selected cars in the car configurator.</p>

<details><summary style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold">Use of Škoda ID</summary>

<p style="margin-left: 3vw">Škoda ID is your single sign-on identity in the digital world of Škoda Auto. Therefore, you do not need to register again for each digital product. The use of your Škoda ID is, and will remain, free of charge for you at all times.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3vw">Note that there might be digital products you can use only with your Škoda ID. Information about whether you need a Škoda ID to use a digital product is always included in the interface.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 3vw; italic; font-weight: bold">What obligations do you have when using the digital products? </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw"> You undertake to ensure that you will not use the digital products in a way that violates these Terms, legal requirements, third party rights or moral standards. This also applies if you grant third parties access to the digital products. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw"> When using the digital products, copyright, name and trademark rights as well as our other rights and third parties’ rights (in particular personal rights) must be respected. You may not use the interface in a way that violates these Terms. You must not misuse the interface in any way; in particular, you may not integrate parts of the application, website or infotainment with other interfaces, whether private or commercial, or distribute them commercially. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw"> You may use the digital products while driving only if it won’t distract you from what is happening on the road and only if legal requirements for road traffic are observed. You are aware that while using the digital products you are always obliged to pay attention to driving and you bear full responsibility for traffic safety. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw"> If a third party (e.g., your family member or your employee) has access to the interface, you must take suitable steps (e.g. obtain that third party's consent) to ensure that their access to the digital products does not infringe their third party rights. Note that you may get access to information about the third party’s activities and therefore (indirectly) get access to their personal data (user conduct, last parking location, etc.). </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw">You use digital products at your own risk, unless expressly stated otherwise in the interface. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-weight: bold">What are the consequences of violating the Terms? </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw"> If you violate any of the obligations in these Terms or applicable law, you will be liable for the reimbursement of all damage suffered by us, and you undertake to release us from any claims of third parties arising from such violations. We can also limit or restrict your access to the digital products in that case. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-weight: bold">What rights do we have when providing the digital products? </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw">Since we are continually refining the content and scope of our digital products, their functions and availability may change in the future to provide you with the best user experience and comfort when using our digital products. Functionalities may be either extended or restricted. You are not entitled to retain a specific scope of function. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw">We also reserve the right to pilot for a limited period of time and/or for specific market(s) and/or for a specific group of customers new features, functions, interfaces or products related to services, without any notice. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-weight: bold">How is our responsibility limited? </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw">We are not responsible for: </p>

<ul style="margin-left: 5vw"><span style="font-weight: bold">a)</span>	ensuring that the data, content and information provided by us or by third parties for the digital products is up to date, correct, accurate, complete and/or of good quality.

<ul style="margin-left: 5vw"><span style="font-weight: bold">b)</span>	any damage incurred if you have selected an unsuitable password or have not kept the password safe in violation of the Terms, or any damage or losses caused by a third party to whom you have granted access to the digital products.</ul>

<ul style="margin-left: 5vw"><span style="font-weight: bold">c)</span>	any damage incurred as a result of improper or incorrect use of the digital products. This applies particularly if you are driving and are distracted from the traffic situation while driving as a result of using the digital products and this leads to an accident.</ul>

<ul style="margin-left: 5vw"><span style="font-weight: bold">d)</span>	any damage that has been incurred due to a difference between display of warnings and messages on the interfaces, or difference between the interfaces and actual traffic or other situation. </ul>

<ul style="margin-left: 5vw"><span style="font-weight: bold">e)</span>	continuous and uninterrupted availability of the digital products or interfaces or their compatibility with your software or hardware systems.

<p style="margin-left: 3vw; font-weight: bold">Is our liability for damages limited? </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw">Even though we are both obliged to prevent damage caused to the other party, such damage may occur. In that case, note that there are certain situations where we cannot be liable for damages caused to you. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw">We will not be liable for any server outages of a technical nature caused through no fault of our own. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that digital products are available again as soon as possible in such case. </p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw">We are liable according to legal requirements for damage to life, body or health, which results from a culpable breach of obligation by us. We are also liable for intentional harm and gross negligence in accordance with digital product liability legislation and for warranties or assurances expressly granted by us.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw">We may otherwise be held liable for simple negligence only in relation to digital products which are paid for and only if there is a violation of essential contractual obligations, i.e., obligations whose fulfilment is essential for the due and proper fulfilment of the contract, and upon which the user may reasonably rely. In these cases, claims for compensation will be limited in sum to providing compensation for foreseeable, direct damages that typically arise due to the nature of the contract. We do not assume liability for incidental damages (including loss of profit).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 5vw">Furthermore, we are liable in accordance with the following provisions: </p>

<ul style="margin-left: 5vw"><span style="font-weight: bold">a)</span>	If legal requirements call for us to pay for damages caused as a result of slight negligence, we will only be liable to a limited extent: we will only be liable if we have breached one of our essential contractual obligations. This liability will also be limited to damages which are foreseeable and typical at the time the contract is concluded. </ul>

<ul style="margin-left: 5vw"><span style="font-weight: bold">b)</span>	 Independent of culpability of Škoda Auto, possible liability due to fraudulent concealment of a fault, due to the assumption of a warranty or in accordance with product liability law remains unaffected. </ul>

<ul style="margin-left: 5vw"><span style="font-weight: bold">c)</span>	 Personal liability of our legal representatives, vicarious agents and employees for damage caused by them through ordinary negligence is excluded. For damage and losses caused by these persons through gross negligence, with the exception of our legal representatives and managers, the limitations of liability in this section governing such situations for Škoda Auto apply. </ul>
